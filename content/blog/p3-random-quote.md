## **[Random Quote Machine] (https://codepen.io/ndronova/pen/oMvqBO)**
I started learning about API, callback functions, JSON and asynchronous JS! First time I went through the respective section on Udemy, I barely understood anything. I had to listen to another course covering the same material and google a lot to come up with this basic [Random Quote Generator] (https://codepen.io/ndronova/pen/oMvqBO).

I used [random quote API made by Tadas Talaikis](https://talaikis.com/random_quotes_api/).

## *What I did before starting*
* [“Modern JavaScript From The Beginning” with Brad Traversy (Udemy Course)](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/v4/overview) – Section 7, lectures 56 to 62.
    * I stopped at creating custom HTTP Library project. I feel like I would need a couple of days to understand everything that was going on in that lecture. I also skipped through lecture on Callback functions.
* [“The Complete JavaScript Course 2018: Build Real Projects” with Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview) (Udemy Course) – Section 8, lectures 119 – 122.
