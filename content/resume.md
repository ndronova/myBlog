One of the first things I heard when starting to learn web development was “Do projects, not tutorials”. I, of course, didn’t listen. I did multiple tutorials on Lynda.com, YouTube, Udemy and I thought I was doing great: I understood the concepts and did code-along websites. However, looking back at it,  “% of course completed” gave me a false sense of progress: I recognized the patterns but couldn’t replicate them on my own.

My first project completed with just HTML and CSS showed me how faulty this logic was. I knew nothing! After this revelation I did a few more static web pages and the process didn’t get any easier, I just got a bit better at googling.

Now I’m learning Vanilla JavaScript and doing my best to give equal attention to tutorials and projects.
